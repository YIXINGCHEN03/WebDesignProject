                    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <h5>David</h5>
                    <p>Thanks for looking! I'm David, and this is <a href="index.html">my travel blog</a>. I'm an American who has been traveling the world full time for 8 years. Nowadays, I'm usually in <a href="#">Bali, Indonesia</a>, with my <a href="#wife">wife Intan.</a></p>
                    <p>I first fell in love with travel on a solo road trip across <a href="#">Iceland</a> in 2016. My budget was small, so I slept in the back of a rental car for 1 month while I drove 7,000 kilometers around the country, filming all of the scenic places in Iceland. One of my first videos racked up a few million views and was featured on international TV by <a href="#">BBC Travel.</a> </p>
                    <p>Since then I've solo traveled to many developing countries, including almost every country in Asia, Central America, and the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>I experienced the 7.0 Lombok earthquake in Indonesia in 2018, <a href="#"> the bombings in Bangkok in 2019</a>, and a fair share of scams, fights, sicknesses, car accidents, and other crazy things along the way.</p>
                    <p>It hasn't always been easy, but over the years I've been blessed with some amazing experiences like sleeping in jungle treehouses in Bali, trekking to Mount Everest Base Camp in the Himalayas, going on Komodo dragon safaris in Indonesia, dining on tarantulas and scorpions in Cambodia, riding a camel to the Great Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, skydiving in Oahu Hawaii, touring medieval Samurai castles in Japan, and visiting some timeless world monuments like the <a href="#">Taj Mahal</a>,<a href="#"> Tikal</a>,<a href="#">Machu Picchu</a>, <a href="#">Hagia Sophia</a>, <a href="#">Angkor Wat, </a>and <a href="#">Petra.</a></p>
                    <p>In 2018, I traveled to 24 countries in one year, which is a personal record so far! I did this on a pretty modest budget and rarely spent more than $30/day on my travels, including lodging and food.</p>
                    <p>I haven't been everywhere, but it's on my list! I'm always looking for new adventures.</p>
                    <p>I hope <a href="index.html">my travel blog</a> can help and inspire you in your own journeys as well!</p>

                    <h5>Intan</h5>
                    <p>I met my sweet wife and full time travel buddy Intan while I was traveling in Asia in 2017, and we got married two years later on a beach in <a href="#">Bali, Indonesia.</a></p>
                    <p>She's a former English teacher, makeup artist and homegrown Balinese. Her name means diamond. She grew up riding a scooter and she's tri-lingual (speaks 3 languages fluently).</p>
                    <p>She's been an indispensable translator for me in remote parts of Indonesia where almost no one speaks English, like <a href="#">Labengki</a> and <a href="#"> the Banyak Islands.</a></p>
                    <p>Intan is a people lover, and her favorite part about travel is trying new food (especially Asian food). She's not into the hiking so much, but she still joins me on volcano hikes and other such adventures.</p>
                    <p>We've been traveling the world full time as a couple for 4+ years now, and we spend a lot of time on her home island Bali. We have some more big international trips planned for 2024.</p>
                    <p>We hope you'll tag along! Please stay tuned!</p>
